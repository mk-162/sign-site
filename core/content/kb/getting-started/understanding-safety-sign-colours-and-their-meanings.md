## Introduction

Discover what red, yellow, blue, and green safety signs mean and when to use each colour according to UK regulations. This guide provides practical, actionable information to help you understand and implement proper safety signage in your workplace.

## Key Points to Remember

Safety signs are a legal requirement in UK workplaces under the Health and Safety (Safety Signs and Signals) Regulations 1996. They serve as a critical communication tool to:

- **Warn** about hazards and risks
- **Mandate** required actions or protective equipment
- **Prohibit** dangerous behaviours
- **Provide** information about safe conditions and emergency procedures

## Understanding Safety Sign Standards

All safety signs in the UK must comply with BS EN ISO 7010:2020, which standardises shapes, colours, and pictograms across industries. This ensures that safety messages are universally understood, regardless of language barriers.

### The Four Main Safety Sign Types

1. **Prohibition Signs (Red)** - Indicate actions that are forbidden
2. **Warning Signs (Yellow)** - Alert to potential hazards
3. **Mandatory Signs (Blue)** - Require specific actions or PPE
4. **Safe Condition Signs (Green)** - Show emergency routes and facilities

## Material Choices for Your Environment

Choosing the right material is crucial for sign durability and compliance:

- **Rigid Plastic** - Versatile, durable, suitable for indoor and outdoor use
- **Self-Adhesive Vinyl** - Easy to apply, ideal for smooth surfaces
- **Photoluminescent** - Glows in darkness, essential for emergency routes
- **Aluminium** - Weather-resistant, perfect for outdoor installations

## Real-World Applications

Consider a typical warehouse environment where various hazards exist:

- **Fire exits** require photoluminescent green signs
- **Forklift areas** need yellow warning signs
- **PPE zones** require blue mandatory signs
- **Restricted areas** need red prohibition signs

## Compliance Checklist

✅ Identify all workplace hazards requiring signage  
✅ Select appropriate sign types according to BS EN ISO 7010  
✅ Choose suitable materials for your environment

## Next Steps

Now that you understand the basics, consider conducting a safety sign audit of your workplace. Look for:

- Missing signs in hazardous areas
- Outdated or non-compliant signage
- Damaged or faded signs requiring replacement
- Areas where additional signage would improve safety
