# How to Install Rigid Plastic Signs

Proper installation ensures your safety signs remain visible, compliant, and durable for years.

## What You'll Need

- Rigid plastic sign
- Spirit level
- Pencil
- Drill with appropriate bit
- Wall plugs and screws (or strong adhesive)
- Tape measure

## Installation Methods

### Method 1: Screw Mounting (Recommended)

1. **Position the sign** at the desired height (typically 1.5m-2m from floor)
2. **Mark the holes** using the sign's pre-drilled corners
3. **Drill pilot holes** using appropriate bit for your wall type
4. **Insert wall plugs** if mounting to masonry
5. **Secure with screws** — don't over-tighten

### Method 2: Adhesive Mounting

1. **Clean the surface** thoroughly and let dry
2. **Apply adhesive** to sign corners and center
3. **Press firmly** for 30 seconds
4. **Allow to cure** for 24 hours before full load

## Height Guidelines

| Location | Recommended Height |
|----------|-------------------|
| General signage | 1.5m - 2m |
| Exit signs | 2m - 2.5m |
| Floor level warnings | 0.3m - 0.5m |

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Installing below eye level
- Over-tightening screws (can crack plastic)
- Not accounting for obstacles
- Ignoring viewing distance requirements

Follow these steps for a professional, compliant installation.
