                When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain
                information about your device, including information about your
                web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies
                installed on your device. Additionally, as you browse the Site,
                we collect information about the individual web pages or
                products that you view, what websites or search terms referred
                you to the Site, and information about how you interact with the
                Site. We refer to this automatically-collected information as
                “Device Information.”
            </p>
            <p>
                We collect Device Information using the following technologies:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1 my-2">

                    <strong>“Cookies”</strong> are data files placed on your device
                    and often include an anonymous unique identifier.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>“Log files”</strong> track actions occurring on the Site
                    and collect data including your IP address, browser type, Internet
                    service provider, referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>“Web beacons,” “tags,” and “pixels”</strong> are electronic
                    files used to record information about how you browse the Site.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Additionally, when you make a purchase or attempt to make a
