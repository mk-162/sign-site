# Installing Rigid Plastic Signs

Rigid plastic (1mm PVC) is a versatile material suitable for both indoor and outdoor use. Here is how to install it securely.

## Method 1: Screw Fixing

1.  **Drill Pilot Holes**: Drill 4 holes in the corners of the sign.
2.  **Mark the Wall**: Hold the sign against the wall and mark the drill points.
3.  **Drill and Plug**: Drill the wall and insert rawl plugs.
4.  **Screw**: Fix the sign using rust-resistant screws and caps for a neat finish.

## Method 2: Adhesive

For smooth surfaces (tiles, glass, painted walls):

1.  **Clean the Surface**: Ensure it is dry and free of grease.
2.  **Apply Tape**: Use high-strength double-sided foam tape or silicone adhesive.
3.  **Press Firmly**: Hold for 30 seconds to ensure a strong bond.

> **Tip**: For outdoor use, screw fixing is recommended to withstand wind and weather.
