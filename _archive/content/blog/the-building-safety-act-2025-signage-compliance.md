The implementation of the **Building Safety Act 2025** marks one of the most significant shifts in UK building regulations in decades. For facility managers, business owners, and 'Accountable Persons,' understanding the implications for **safety signage** is no longer optional—it is a legal necessity.

Following the recommendations of the Grenfell Tower Inquiry, this legislation places a renewed focus on the "Golden Thread" of information and stringent fire safety measures. This article explores strictly what these changes mean for your signage strategy and how to ensure your premises remain compliant.

## The New Regulatory Landscape

The Building Safety Act isn't just about high-rise residential buildings; its principles ripple across all commercial and public premises. The core objective is clear: to ensure that safety information is accessible, accurate, and understood by everyone in the building.

For safety signage, this means the era of "fit and forget" is over. Signage is now considered a critical part of the building's safety ecosystem, requiring regular audits, maintenance, and verification.

## Key Changes Impacting Signage

### 1. The "Golden Thread" of Information

The Act introduces the concept of a "Golden Thread"—a digital record of building safety information that must be maintained throughout the building's lifecycle.

**What this means for signage:**

* **Documentation**: You must document *why* specific signs are placed in specific locations.
* **Consistency**: Signs must match the fire strategy plans exactly. If a fire exit sign is on the plan, it must be on the wall, and vice versa.
* **Up-to-Date Records**: Any changes to the building layout must trigger an immediate review of signage and an update to the digital record.

### 2. Mandatory Fire Door Signage

One of the most specific requirements relates to fire doors. The regulations now mandate clearer, more frequent instruction on fire doors to ensure they remain effective.

* **"Fire Door Keep Shut"**: These signs are non-negotiable on all fire doors.
* **"Fire Door Keep Locked"**: Required for cupboards and service risers.
* **Resident/Occupant Information**: In multi-occupied buildings, information about the importance of fire doors must be prominently displayed (often via signage in communal areas).

### 3. Wayfinding in High-Rise Buildings

For buildings over 11 meters, the Fire Safety (England) Regulations (an extension supported by the Act) necessitate specific wayfinding signage to assist fire and rescue services.

**Requirements include:**

* **Stairway Identification**: Signs identifying the stairwell and floor number must be visible in low-light conditions (classing **photoluminescent signs** as the gold standard).
* **Floor Numbering**: Clear floor markings on every landing.
* **Flat/Unit Indicators**: Signs indicating which units are accessible from each floor output.

## PEEPs and Evacuation Planning

The long-awaited updates on Personal Emergency Evacuation Plans (PEEPs) have clarified the responsibilities of building owners towards residents or employees with reduced mobility.

Signage plays a pivotal role here:

* **Refuge Point Signage**: Clearly marking designated refuge areas is critical. These signs must now often include communication instructions (e.g., how to use the intercom).
* **Alternative Escape Routes**: Signage must cater to all abilities, ensuring that accessible escape routes are as clearly marked as standard routes.

## Consequences of Non-Compliance

The Building Safety Regulator (BSR) has strong enforcement powers. Failure to comply with the Act can result in:

* **Unlimited Fines**: For serious breaches of safety regulations.
* **Imprisonment**: For individuals found liable for safety failures.
* **Reputational Damage**: Public records of enforcement action.
* **Operational Stoppages**: The BSR can issue "stop notices" on buildings deemed unsafe.

## Your Compliance Checklist

To ensure your organisation meets the standards of the Building Safety Act 2025, we recommend the following immediate actions:

1. **Conduct a Signage Audit**: Walk your floor plan. Does every sign match your fire strategy document?
2. **Upgrade to Photoluminescent**: Ensure all emergency escape route signs are photoluminescent (glow-in-the-dark) to meet high-reliability standards.
3. **Check Fire Doors**: Verify every fire door has the correct mandatory signage on both sides where applicable.
4. **Review Wayfinding**: particularly in stairwells and lobbies, ensure floor numbers and directional indicators are clear for emergency responders.
5. **Digital Record**: Take photos of your compliant signage setup and store them as part of your "Golden Thread" documentation.

## Conclusion

The Building Safety Act 2025 is a call to action for higher standards in building safety. **Safety signage** is the visual language of this safety culture. By ensuring your signs are compliant, clear, and well-maintained, you aren't just following the law—you are actively protecting lives.

Don't leave compliance to chance. If you are unsure about your current signage status, consider booking a professional site survey today.
