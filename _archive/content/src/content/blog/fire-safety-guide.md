# The Ultimate Guide to Fire Safety Signs

Ensuring your workplace is equipped with the correct fire safety signage is not just a legal requirement—it's a critical safety measure that saves lives.

## Why ISO 7010 Matters

ISO 7010 is the international standard for safety symbols. It ensures that safety signs are easily recognizable regardless of language or culture.

### Key Categories

1. **Fire Exits**: Green and white, indicating safe escape routes.
2. **Fire Equipment**: Red and white, locating extinguishers and alarms.
3. **Mandatory Actions**: Blue and white, e.g., "Fire Door Keep Shut".

## Placement Tips

* **Eye Level**: Signs should be placed 1.5m to 2m from the floor.
* **Visibility**: Ensure signs are not obstructed by furniture or decorations.
* **Lighting**: Emergency routes must be lit, and photoluminescent signs are recommended.

Stay safe and compliant!
