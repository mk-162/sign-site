## Installation Overview

Learn the correct positioning and mounting heights for safety signs according to UK regulations. Proper installation ensures signs remain secure, visible, and compliant with UK regulations throughout their lifespan.

## Pre-Installation Planning

### 1. Site Survey and Risk Assessment
Before purchasing or installing any signs:

**Identify Hazards**:
- Conduct thorough walkthrough
- Review existing risk assessments
- Consult with supervisors and employees
- Note areas of previous incidents
- Consider future workplace changes

**Map Locations**:
- Plot sign positions on floor plan
- Note viewing distances
- Identify potential obstructions
- Consider lighting conditions
- Plan for emergency evacuation routes

### 2. Regulatory Compliance Check

Ensure installations meet:
- BS EN ISO 7010:2020 (current standard)
- Health and Safety (Safety Signs and Signals) Regulations 1996
- Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety Order 2005)
- Industry-specific requirements (e.g., CDM 2015 for construction)

### 3. Material and Fixing Selection

Match materials to environment:
- Indoor smooth surfaces → Self-adhesive vinyl
- Indoor permanent → Rigid plastic with screws
- Outdoor → Aluminium or weatherproof plastic
- High vandalism → Polycarbonate
- Emergency routes → Photoluminescent

## Height and Positioning Requirements

### Standard Mounting Heights

**General Safety Signs**:
- Optimal height: **1.5m to 2.0m** (eye level)
- Measured from floor to sign center
- Adjust for average workforce height
- Consider wheelchair user sightlines

**Fire Exit Signs**:
- **Above door frames**: 300mm minimum above door
- **Low-level**: 300mm above floor (smoke visibility)
- Both positions recommended for comprehensive safety

**Warning Signs at Hazard Points**:
- **Immediately before hazard**: 2-5m approach distance
- **At point of hazard**: Eye level where safe
- **Entry to hazardous zones**: Door frame level

**Mandatory PPE Signs**:
- **Zone entry points**: Before entry to area
- **1.8m height**: Clear visibility
- **Multiple positions**: For large areas

### Visibility Requirements

Signs must be visible from:
- All normal approach angles
- Expected working positions
- Adequate distance for action/decision time
- Without obstruction when doors/equipment operate

**Minimum Viewing Distances**:
```
Sign Size (mm) | Max Viewing Distance
150 x 150      | 10 metres
200 x 200      | 20 metres
300 x 300      | 30 metres
400 x 400      | 50 metres
600 x 600      | 75 metres
```

### Lighting Considerations

**Adequate Illumination**:
- Minimum 50 lux at sign face
- Consider natural light variations
- Supplement with artificial lighting if needed
- **Or** use photoluminescent signs

**Photoluminescent Requirements**:
- **Mandatory** for emergency routes
- Must receive adequate light charging
- Minimum 54 lux for 15 minutes
- Test regularly for glow performance

## Installation Methods

### Method 1: Screw Fixing (Rigid Signs)

**Best for**: Permanent installations, rigid plastic, aluminium, polycarbonate

**Tools Required**:
- Spirit level
- Tape measure
- Pencil
- Drill with appropriate bits
- Screwdriver or drill driver
- Wall plugs (for masonry)
- Appropriate screws

**Step-by-Step Process**:

1. **Position Sign**:
   - Hold sign at desired location
   - Use spirit level to ensure horizontal
   - Mark center point with pencil

2. **Mark Fixing Holes**:
   - Mark all fixing hole positions
   - Typically 4 corners for stability
   - Large signs may need additional center fixings

3. **Drill Pilot Holes**:
   - Select appropriate drill bit
   - For masonry: Use masonry bit, insert wall plugs
   - For wood/plaster: Smaller pilot hole prevents splitting
   - For metal: Use metal drill bit

4. **Fix Sign**:
   - Align sign with pilot holes
   - Insert screws through sign into holes
   - Tighten evenly, don't over-tighten
   - Check level again
   - Ensure sign sits flat against surface

**Screw Selection Guide**:
- **Indoor/Dry**: Standard steel screws
- **Outdoor/Damp**: Stainless steel or coated screws
- **Chemical environments**: Chemical-resistant fasteners
- **Size**: Appropriate for sign weight and material

### Method 2: Self-Adhesive Installation (Vinyl Signs)

**Best for**: Smooth surfaces, non-permanent installations, lightweight signs

**Surface Requirements**:
- Smooth (not textured or rough)
- Clean and dry
- Free from grease/dust/moisture
- Temperature above 10°C during application

**Tools Required**:
- Cleaning cloth
- Degreaser/alcohol wipes
- Squeegee or soft cloth
- Tape measure
- Spirit level
- Pencil (for positioning marks)

**Step-by-Step Process**:

1. **Surface Preparation** (Critical):
   - Clean thoroughly with degreaser
   - Remove all dust, grease, and contaminants
   - Dry completely
   - For painted surfaces, ensure paint fully cured (28 days)

2. **Position Marking**:
   - Measure and mark desired position
   - Use spirit level for alignment
   - Light pencil marks at corners

3. **Application**:
   - Peel back 2-3cm of backing paper
   - Align sign with position marks
   - Slowly press down from one edge
   - Gradually peel backing while smoothing sign
   - Use squeegee to prevent air bubbles
   - Work from center outward

4. **Final Steps**:
   - Press firmly along all edges
   - Pay special attention to corners
   - Remove any air bubbles by pushing toward edge
   - Allow 24 hours cure time before exposure

**Temperature Considerations**:
- Ideal application: 15-25°C
- Below 10°C: Adhesive may not bond properly
- Above 30°C: Difficult to handle, may bubble

**Common Failure Causes**:
- Surface not clean/dry
- Application in cold conditions
- Insufficient pressure on edges
- Premature exposure to weather

### Method 3: Cable Tie Fixing (Mesh/Fencing)

**Best for**: Wire mesh, chain link fencing, temporary barriers

**Tools Required**:
- UV-resistant cable ties
- Cable tie gun or pliers
- Wire cutters

**Process**:
1. Position sign on mesh/fencing
2. Thread cable tie through sign holes and mesh
3. Pull tight with cable tie gun
4. Cut excess tie length
5. Use minimum 4 cable ties per sign
6. Check regularly and replace degraded ties

---

### Method 4: Magnetic Fixing (Temporary)

**Best for**: Temporary signs on steel surfaces (e.g., vehicles, containers)

**Requirements**:
- Ferrous metal surface
- Clean, smooth surface
- Strong neodymium magnets for outdoor use

**Process**:
1. Clean metal surface
2. Attach magnetic fixings to sign
3. Position carefully (strong magnets attract suddenly)
4. Check security regularly
5. Remove during high winds if lightweight

**Limitations**:
- Only on ferrous metals
- Regular checking essential
- Not for permanent installations
- Can be removed by others

## Common Installation Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Incorrect Height
**Problem**: Signs too high or low for optimal visibility  
**Solution**: Follow 1.5-2.0m guideline, adjust for specific situations

### Mistake 2: Obstructions Ignored
**Problem**: Sign hidden when doors open, equipment moved, or seasonal changes  
**Solution**: Test all operational scenarios before final fixing

### Mistake 3: Poor Surface Preparation
**Problem**: Self-adhesive signs fall off within days  
**Solution**: Thorough cleaning, degreasing, and drying before application

### Mistake 4: Wrong Fixing Method
**Problem**: Rigid signs with adhesive backing on textured walls  
**Solution**: Match fixing method to sign material and surface type

### Mistake 5: Inadequate Size
**Problem**: Sign too small for viewing distance  
**Solution**: Use viewing distance chart to select appropriate size

### Mistake 6: No Photoluminescent on Fire Exits
**Problem**: Exit signs invisible during power failure  
**Solution**: Always use photoluminescent or emergency lit signs
