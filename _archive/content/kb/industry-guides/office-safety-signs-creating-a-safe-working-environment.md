## Common Industry-Specific Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Generic Signage for Specific Risks
**Problem**: Standard warning signs don't address industry-specific hazards  
**Solution**: Use industry-specific supplementary text or custom signs

### Mistake 2: Overlooking Visitor Safety
**Problem**: Signs assume knowledge that visitors don't have  
**Solution**: Clear induction signage, visitor PPE information, restricted area marking

### Mistake 3: Inadequate Bilingual Signage
**Problem**: Non-English speakers can't read text-heavy signs  
**Solution**: Use pictogram-only signs where possible, provide bilingual versions

### Mistake 4: Ignoring Seasonal Changes
**Problem**: Signs obscured by stored inventory in busy seasons  
**Solution**: Plan for worst-case scenarios, position signs above storage heights

### Mistake 5: Insufficient Coverage
**Problem**: Assuming one sign is enough for large areas  
**Solution**: Multiple signs ensure visibility from all approach points
